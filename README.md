# fmm_add_reduction
A Python repository for minimizing the number of additions in fast matrix multiplication algorithms.

2024-12-20:

This repo corresponds to the paper "The Number of the Beast: Reducing Additions in Fast Matrix Multiplication Algorithms for Dimensions up to 666", available on ePrint in a few days.

Code is currently not really cleaned up. Code to come in early January. For now, have a look at our C implementation for the same thing at https://github.com/werekorren/fmm_add_reduction.
